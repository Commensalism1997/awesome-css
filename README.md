# How to contribute
### Recommendations
- Annotate your theme, so people know what part is responsible for what and  are able to tweak theme for their own
  - ```css
    /* Accents headers with blue colour */
    h1, h2, h3, h4
    {
        color: aquamarine;
    }
    ```
### Rules
- Add your theme on list below (You also can add what theme you used as base)
  - Sample:
    ```
    (Theme name) by (Author)
    (Theme name) by (Author), based on (Original theme name)
    ```
- Don't edit other people's theme unless there's code mistype/mistake
  - If you want to change it, copy their theme and create your own on base of theirs
- Please don't use vulgar words in names of classes or comments
